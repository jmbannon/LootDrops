# LootDrops
A Minecraft plugin that spawns loot using customized regions. This plugin is a part of the Project Zombie plugin collection.

## TODO
- Use WorldGuard regions for storing and swapping original states with loot states
- Configurable loot drop automation

## Our Message
We are strong advocates for fair, fun, and balanced Minecraft gameplay. We do not condone the current tactics employed by commercial servers for the sole purpose of profit revenue such as selling over-powered items, pay to be unbanned, ridiculously high pricing of cosmetic items, etc. The list goes on.

We strive to build a suite of plugins that can be modified by anyone with hopes that it contributes to small, community-ran servers willing to open-source. These plugins will be used by the Project Zombie server which will eventually be available to everyone to deploy their own custom instance.
